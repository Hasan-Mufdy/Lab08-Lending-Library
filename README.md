this is a simple book lending library application, made using C#.
it allows users to add new books to their collection, manage them, borrow them, create a backpack to pack and unpack them.

### example output (in the console):

Book 2 is now added to borrowed.
Book 2 , name: firstname lastname pages: 500
the Book: Book 2 is now unpacked
```
this example shows that a book titled "book 2" is added to the borrowed list, the details of the book, including the author's name and the number of pages, are then displayed. After that, it was unpacked.
